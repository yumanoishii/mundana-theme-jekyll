Yesterday my hammie Ses died.&nbsp;

He was so active until his last breath. I even saw him moving in the morning before going to work. I wished I knew it was his last day.&nbsp;

Life is as such: no matter how you feel, whether you want it or not, things happen.&nbsp;

It's interesting that humans like to control our environment and bend reality to their wishes. But ultimately they lose to the passage of time and the inevitability of passings.&nbsp;

Of course I'm sad that hammie Ses died. I've been with him for over 2 years with him always by my side and willing to keep me company despite me annoying him when he wants to sleep.&nbsp;

I still remember the first day I got Ses. He was the first ham to climb up my hand and not wanting to get off. More so than I chose him, he chose me.&nbsp;

I miss him already. Sometimes I look forward to coming home because I wanted to go bother him and play with him, or even have him sleep by my side. I know he's not a puppy, but he was still a social ham who wasn't afraid of going on adventures. He was curious and smart, always wanting to see more outside of his habitat.&nbsp;

He made me want to learn more about hams and how to improve their habitats. I also often wondered about their natural habitats in Syria where it's full of sand and plenty of places to burrow.&nbsp;

I buried Ses with his beloved wheel. He loved to run on it no matter what day it was. He also loved to burrow. He wasn't much of a biter. He was smaller than his brother and other siblings. He also made many sounds and loved to run.&nbsp;

I'm glad I had Ses and other hams with me during this pandemic and hellscape of a time period. Even though I wish I didn't have to be living in this crisis world where nations are on the verges of collapse and so is the earth, it was ultimately worth living for the many present moments. Ses is one of the creatures that made me appreciate living during the hardest times. So small and short-lived, Ses seems insignificant. But it is these small pieces of life that makes it worth living.&nbsp;

Ses, I hope you get to eat many apples and run free whereever you are now. Thank&nbsp; you for living with me and choosing me.&nbsp;
