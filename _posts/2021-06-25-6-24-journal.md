Haven't written in a while so wanted to pop in and put some thoughts down.&nbsp;

Recently it's been busy with various life events, but still thinking hard about the current state of the world.&nbsp;

It's wild that over half a million people have died, mostly in the service industry, yet we are in some kind of "back to normal".&nbsp;

Schools are coming back, places are reopening.&nbsp;

Yet so many people have died, the haunting news of open positions with no one to fill them.&nbsp;

The one nice thing is that many people are no longer taking jobs for starvation wages.&nbsp;

But that isn't enough.&nbsp;

It's just so scary that so many people have died and things just proceed as usual. It's like putting on a sick show...but for whom?
